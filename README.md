## Usage

Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to use the MLX Audio library for different functionalities.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

To convert text to speech, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
from mlx_audio import TextToSpeech

tts = TextToSpeech()
tts.speak("Hello, welcome to the MLX Audio library!")
```

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

For speech recognition, use the STT feature as follows:

```python
from mlx_audio import SpeechToText

stt = SpeechToText()
text = stt.recognize("path/to/audio/file.wav")
print(text)
```

### Speech-to-Speech (STS)

To modify speech, you can utilize the STS feature:

```python
from mlx_audio import SpeechToSpeech

sts = SpeechToSpeech()
modified_audio = sts.transform("path/to/input/audio.wav", effect="robotic")
sts.save(modified_audio, "path/to/output/audio.wav")
```
